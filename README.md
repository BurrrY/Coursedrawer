***CourseDrawer*** 
=================

External tool to draw and edit Courseplay courses directly to the XML File 

[CourseDrawer!](https://github.com/pseudex/Coursedrawer/blob/master/CourseDrawer_v5.zip) is an application that has been updated and prepared for working with the new version of CoursePlay 5.0 (FS2017, LS17)

Courses are now saved by courseplay in individual files. In order to load the courses you still need to load courseManager.xml which you can find here:
+ Goldcrest Valley Map: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\my games\FarmingSimulator2017\CoursePlay_Courses\Map**01**\courseManager.xml
+ Sosnovska Map: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\my games\FarmingSimulator2017\CoursePlay_Courses\Map**02**\courseManager.xml

In the Install Path of the game. For example D:\Spiele\Farming Simulator 2017\data\maps
You can find the background images you can load in CourseDrawer for your map. You can load the bmp or the dds file.

Please be aware you're using a developer version, which may and will contain errors, bugs, mistakes and unfinished code. Chances are you computer will explode when using it. Twice. If you have no idea what "beta", "alpha", or "developer" means and entails, steer clear. The team will not take any responsibility for crop destroyed or savegames deleted. You have been warned.

If you're still ok with this, please remember to post possible issues that you find in the developer version. That's the only way we can find sources of error and fix them. Be as specific as possible.
